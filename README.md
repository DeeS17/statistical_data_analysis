A telecom operator company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The advertising department wants to choose which prepaid plan generates more revenue to match the advertising budget.

I will do an initial analysis of the prepaid packages based on a relatively small sample of users. The sample contains 500 user data and contains: who they are, where they are from, what type of plan they use, and the number of calls and messages they sent in 2018. I will analyze client behavior and determine which prepaid plans bring in more revenue.
